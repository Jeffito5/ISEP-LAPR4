# US1900 - Bootstrap
=======================================

# 1. Requirements

####Description:
>As Project Manager, I intend that, for demonstration purposes, the system has the possibility of being initialized (bootstrap) with some information related to the product catalog and auxiliary information (e.g., categories of products).

###Client Clarifications:

####Customer

* >**Q:** Some questions arose as to which format each information should be in, namely:
  >
  >**Name** - should we consider first name, last name or is there anything more worth capturing? Are there length restrictions?
  >
  >**VAT id**- which length should it have? Is it only digits or could there be letters?
  >
  >**Phone number**: which lenght/format?
  >
  >**Birthday** - in which format?
  >
  >**Address** - What kind of format are we expecting for these? Street name, door number, postal code, city, country is a valid format or are we missing anything?
  >
  >**A:**
  ><br> **Name:** at least a first and last name is required. Although, desirably the customer should specify his/her full name. Considering this, apply the min/max length you consider as reasonable to meet this requirement.
  ><br><br> **VAT ID:** varies from one country to another. Usually it has letters and numbers (cf. here). The system must be prepared to support/recognize several VAT Ids.
  ><br><br> **Phone number:** according to international standards (e.g.: +351 934 563 123).
  ><br><br> **Birthday:** it is a date... you can adopt year/month/day.
  ><br><br> **Address:** I think you said it all.

* >**Q:** We have the knowledge that the clerk can create a order on behalf of a given costumer and with that the system might request additional information regarding the source order information, on the project descriptions gives the example of phone number, email and others.
  >
  >What additional information do you need more?
  <<br><br>
  > **A:** Regarding that topic, it is import to recall the following:
  >
  >"At least for some organizations, it is also important that the system allows sales department clerks to create orders on behalf of a given customer. Thus, the system should collect the required information to distinguish between those orders registered directly by the customer and the ones registered by a clerk. In the latter case, due trackability concerns, the system should be able (at least) to identify the respective clerk."
  >
  >Despite identifying the clerk registering the order, it is important to register (i) the source channel (e.g.: phone, email, meeting, etc...), (ii) the date/time when such interaction happen and (iii) optionally add some comment.

####Product:
* >**Q:** It was mentioned in a previous question that both the production code and the internal code have a set regular expression, could an example of said regular expressions be given?
  <br><br>
  > **A:** For example, 4 letters followed by a dot (".") and ending with 5 digits.
  > <br>[Link to forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=15753#p20247)

* >**Q:** The development team wonders whether in a product registration the attributes "photo", "internal code", "short description", "extended description", "technical description", "brand", "reference", "production code" are mandatory and how big they are?
  <<br><br>
  > **A:** Some information regarding each of those attributes:
  >
  >**photo:** it might be of any common format (e.g. png, jpeg, svg);
  >
  >**short description:** not empty having 30 chars maximum;
  >  
  >**extended description:** not empty with a minimum of 20 chars and 100 chars maximum;
  >
  >**technical description:** multiple lines of text, preferably with no limit or the biggest possible.
  >
  > **brand:** not empty having 50 chars maximum;
  >
  > **reference:** not empty alphanumeric code with at 23 chars maximum;
  >
  > **production code:** not empty alphanumeric code with at 23 chars maximum however it might meet a given regular expression defined/configured at deployment time.
  >
  >**internal code:** not empty alphanumeric code with at 23 chars maximum however it might meet a given regular expression defined/configured at deployment time.
  ><br><br> 
  >Mandatory attributes: internal code, short and extended description.
  >
  >In accordance with the specification document, other attributes might also be mandatory.

* >**Q:** In document "brand name and reference." - Reference refers to the brand reference or product reference?
  <<br><br>
  > **A:** The complete sentence is "Products basic information comprehends a unique internal code, a short and an extended description as well as a more technical description, a set of photos, a brand name and reference.".
  >
  >The intent was to express that a product has:
  >
  >a brand name (e.g.: "Samsung", "Nokia", "Bic"); and the product reference set by the brand, which is an alphanumeric code (max. 23 chars).
  > <br>[Link to forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=15488#p19926)


* >**Q:** Can the regular expression be changed by an employee, if so which one?
  > <br><br>
  > **A:** No! Such regular expressions are set by configuration at system implantation time.
  > <br> [Link to forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=15753#p20247)
  > <br><u> **NOTE:** Probably going to be defined in a configuration file.</u>

---


####Survey

* >**Q:** When we create a survey, is there a default set of question predefined when creating it, or do we need to create the questions themselves one by one for every survey?
  <<br><br>
  > **A:** No. All surveys are distinct. As so, each survey is defined from the scratch.
