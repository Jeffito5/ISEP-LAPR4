# 1. Requirements

####Description:
>As Sales Clerk, I want to view/search the products catalog.

###Client Clarifications:

* >**Q:** Regarding the product search, is there a field you want to use to filter the data and any desired data presentation order? And do you want to see all the fields or just a simplified summary?
  <br><br>
  >**A:**
  Commonly fields used to filter products are:Category; Description (any of the available descriptions); Brand. User should select/specify a data presentation order. This applies to any similar US. At least the product' code, short description, brand, category and unit price should be presented. More details can be presented for a given/selected product at user request.

* >**Q:** Should the sales clerk select/specify the catalog presentation order before he/she can see the catalog? Or the catalog is presented in a default order, and then if the sales clerk wants, he/she can change it? The same doubt came on the filtering.
  <br><br>
  > **A:** Data to be used to filter the products catalog content should be asked ahead.
