####Description:
>As Sales Clerk, I want to specify a new product for sale.

###Client Clarifications:

* >**Q:** Can the Product be a part of a Super Category and a Category or will the Product be a part of a Category and that Category is a part of the Super Category?
  <br><br>
  >**A:** By simplicity, a category consists only of an alphanumeric code, and a description. Each product belongs mandatorily to a single category.
  As so, and contrary to what is suggested in your question, there is no hierarchy between categories.

* >**Q:** Regarding the barcode of a given product what should the coding standard be?
  <br><br>
  > **A:** Any of the supported standards. It might be set by configuration at system implantation time.

* >**Q:** Still regarding the barcode should the identifier be sequential, if not what method should we use to generate the identifier?
  <br><br>
  > **A:** Barcodes are manually introduced by users since each product barcode is provided by the product manufacture.

* >**Q:** It was mentioned in a previous question that both the production code and the internal code have a set regular expression, could an example of said regular expressions be given?
  <br><br>
  > **A:** For example, 4 letters followed by a dot (".") and ending with 5 digits.

* >**Q:** About the photo in the product, we would like to know how it is associated to the product. Should we write the path to it, or should a window open to import the photo into the program?
      <br><br>
      > **A:** From a usability perspective, it would be better having a window (or any other way) to select the photo file to be uploaded.

* >**Q:** The development team wonders what attributes of the product may differ per unit, i.e. from unit 1 and unit 2 of product A what may be different?
      <br><br>
      > **A:** For simplicity, consider that there is no distinct attributes per product unit (e.g.: serial number).
  > <br>[Link to forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=15968)

* >**Q:** Given that all the units of a product are located in a single warehouse, should in the moment of creation of the product the sales clerk chose one of the available? If so should it indicate the aisle, row and shelf, where the products are located?
      <br><br>
      > **A:**
      Yes, the product location might be specified during US 1001.

* >**Q:** Inside of a row should products of the same "id" or they can be different types of products inside the row? If every row has one "id" type of product will simplify things.
      <br><br>
      > **A:** I believe that it is clear that on the same row might exist different types of products. For instance, if the row is split on two shelves, on one shelf might store units of product A while the other shelf might store units of product B.
  > <br>[Link to forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=15971)
 
* >**Q:** When creating a new Product, what Currency should we use?
      <br><br>
      > **A:** The system should work adopting a base currency (e.g.: EUR) and, according to the customer location, be able to present prices on other currencies (e.g. USD) using an external currency converter.

* >**Q:** Is a product's availability related to wether they are in shelves or not? By that i mean, can a product be available even thought it isn't in a shelf or are they by default unavailable.
      <br><br>
      > **A:** In the scope of this prototype, you may consider that products are always available (no stock management is required).

# 2. Analysis

*In this section the team should describe the study/analysis/comparison done with the meaning to take the best options
of design for the functionality as well as apply the suited diagrams/artifacts of analysis.*

*It is recommended to organize the content by subsections.*

## 2.1. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

![US1001-SSD](US1001-SSD.png)

# 3. Design

*In this section the team should describe the adopted design to satisfy the functionality. Among others, the team should
present the functionality development diagram(s), class diagram(s), identification of patterns applied and which were the
principal tests specified to validate the functionality.*

*Beyond the suggested sections, others can be included.*

## 3.1. Functionality development

*In this section should be presented and described the flow/sequence that allows to run the functionality.*

# 4. Implementation

*In this section the team show provide, if necessary, some evidence that the implementation is in accordance with the design developed.
Beyond that, show be mentioned/described the existence of any other relevant file (e.g. configuration) e highlight relevant commits.*

*It is recommended to organize this content in subsections.*

# 5. Integration/Demonstration

*In this section the team should describe the efforts made to integrate the developed functionality with the remaining functionality of the system.*

# 6. Observations

*In this section is suggested to present a critic view about the pointed developed work, for example, other ways and/or future works related.*
