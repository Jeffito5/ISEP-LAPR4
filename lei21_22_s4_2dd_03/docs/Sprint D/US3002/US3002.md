  > <br> Distribution (in %) of responses for each alternative (e.g.: A = 30%, B = 27%, C = 40%, Others = 3%)
  > <br> Distribution (in %) of combined responses (e.g.: A+B = 15%, A+C = 100%, B+C=100%, A+B+C=10%)
  > <br><br> For “Sorting-Options” questions:
  > <br> Distribution of the various hypotheses for each position (e.g.: 1st Place = A(40%) B (60%) C(0%); 2nd Place = A(50%) B(40%) C(10%); 3rd Place =A(10%) C(90%))

  > <br><br> Saving the report is not seen as relevant since, at any time, the user might request to see the report 
  > again. Notice that the information on which the report is computed is already persisted on the system.

## 4. Annotations

For this User Story, the "Report" class created was not persisted in the database as explained in the forum. 
The report can be generated at any time about any survey with a questionnaire. 
An auxiliary class was created that works as a calculator for all the percentages and accounts needed for the report.
Although the report is not persisted, it was assigned an id and 2 dates.

Confirmations/Verifications:

* Checks if the option chosen to generate a report is valid.
* Checks if there are surveys available.
* Checks if the option chosen to choose a survey is valid.
* Checks if both dates are in the right format.
