US5004
=======================================

# 1. Requirements

*In this section the team should indicate the developed functionality as well as describe its interpretation and its
correlation and/or dependency of/with others requirements.*

## 1.1. User Story Description and Interpretation

**US5004:** "As Project Manager, I want the output communications  (of the AGV Digital Twin) made through the SPOMS2022 protocol to be secured/protected."

**Acceptance Criteria:** "It should be adopted SSL/TLS with mutual authentication based on public key certificates. It complements the US5002."

# 2. Implementation

When implementing this user story the technical team adopted SSL/TLC protocol with mutual authentication based on <u>public-key certificates</u>.

SSL/TLS is a protocol designed to enforce security in network communications over UDP and over TCP.

Public Key Certificates are used to authenticate public keys, and it can only be decrypted with the matching private key.

## 2.1. Commands

To generate and manage public key certificates and private keys the development team used the following <i>keytool</i> command:
<li>keytool -genkey -v -alias dtserver -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 365 -keystore dtserver.jks –storepass Password1</li>
<li>keytool -genkey -v -alias dtclient -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 365 -keystore dtclient.jks –storepass Password1</li>

Doing that the server.jks file was created.

## 2.2. Application's Settings

Each application (server and client) must load its own public key certificate and corresponding private key, this public
key certificate will be provided to the remote application during the SSL/TLS handshake. They are loaded from the Java
Key Store by using the following settings:

<li>System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore", “dtserver.jks”);</li>
<li>System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword",”Password1”);</li>
<li>System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStore", “dtclient.jks”);</li>
<li>System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword",”Password1”);</li>
