# US1901
=======================================

# 1. Requirements

#### Description:

> As Project Manager, I want that the "OrdersServer" component supports properly, at request, the needs of the "
> CustomerApp" application.

###### Acceptance Criteria:

> It must be used the provided application protocol (SPOMS2022).
> It is suggested the adoptiong of concurrent mechanisms (e.g. threads) and state sharing between these mechanisms.
> In this sprint, for demonstration purposes, it is acceptable to mock processing some of the incoming requests.

### Project Clarifications:

* > Another console application, called “Customer Application”, suitable for the customer needs. This application will be installed/running on the customers personal computers, not managed by the company. For that reason, a direct connection to the database (graphically depicted on red) must be avoid. Instead, data requests should be made through the “Orders API” exposed by the “Orders Server” component.

* > A server application, called “Orders Server”, responsible to fulfill the all the data requests necessary to the “Customer Application” works properly. The set of available/possible requests must be minimized and, each one, should have a very specific purpose (e.g.: add a product to the shopping cart, check the status of his/her open orders).

### Client Clarifications:

* > **Q:** Besides the communication requests that have already been provided in the system description (add a product to the shopping cart and check status of a customer's order), do you have any other specific request you would like to be implemented regarding the communication between the two applications mentioned before?
  <br><br>
  > **A:**
  > The "Customer Application" runs on customers PC/Laptop, which are not managed by the company.
  > Thus, any functionality made available to customers through such application should be developed having in mind communication constraints and security. As so, all "Customer Application" data requests should be made through the “Orders API” exposed by the “Orders Server” component.
  > Notice that you are developing a system following an iterative and incremental process/method. This means that, future needs may differ from current needs. Focus on current needs (Sprint C) and give a look to further needs (Sprint D).

* > **Q:** Regarding the USs 1901,4001, 5001, and 5002, what would you consider its complete state, that is, what would be the criterion to define whether or not this US is functional?
  <br><br>
  > **A:**
  > For all of those US, the communication between the two involved components must be implemented in accordance with the SPOMS2022. The requests processing can be somehow mocked. For instance, if processing a request implies saving some data to the database, the component can instead write such data to a log (mocking). Latter, on next sprint, the teams implement the interaction to the database.
  > However, it is not advisable mocking everything, namely the components (internal) state. Notice that by mocking you are letting extra effort to the next sprint.
  > Finally, all US must be demonstrable.

This field is a single byte and should be interpreted as an unsigned integer (0 to 255). The present message format version number is one.                                                                           |

It should be interpreted as an unsigned integer (0 to 255).                                                                                                      |
| D_LENGTH_1 |   2    |   1    | These two fields are used to specify the length in bytes of the DATA field. Both these fields are to be interpreted as unsigned integer numbers (0 to 255). The length of the DATA field is to be calculated as follows: D_LENGTH_1 + 256 x D_LENGTH_2. The length of the DATA field may be zero, meaning it does not exist. |
| D_LENGTH_2 |   3    |   1    | These two fields are used to specify the length in bytes of the DATA field. Both these fields are to be interpreted as unsigned integer numbers (0 to 255). The length of the DATA field is to be calculated as follows: D_LENGTH_1 + 256 x D_LENGTH_2. The length of the DATA field may be zero, meaning it does not exist. |

|:----:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0   | COMMTEST - Communications test request with no other effect on the server application than the response with a code two message (ACK). This request has no data.                                       |
|  1   | DISCONN - End of session request. The server is supposed to respond with a code two message, afterwards both applications are expected to close the session (TCP connection). This request has no data |
|  2   | ACK - Generic acknowledgment message. Used in response to requests with codes zero and one but may be used for other requests. This response has no data.                                              |
