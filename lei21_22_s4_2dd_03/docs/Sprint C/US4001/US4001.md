US4001
=======================================

# 1. Requirements

*In this section the team should indicate the developed functionality as well as describe its interpretation and its
correlation and/or dependency of/with others requirements.*

## 1.1. User Story Description and Interpretation

**US4001:** “As Project Manager, I want that the "AGVManager" component supports properly, at request, the needs of the 
'BackOfficeApp' application as well as the needs the AGV digital twin.“

## 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- Question: "Regarding the USs 1901,4001, 5001, and 5002, what would you consider its complete state, that is, what would
- be the criterion to define whether or not this US is functional?"

    - Answer: "For all of those US, the communication between the two involved components must be implemented in accordance
  with the SPOMS2022. The requests processing can be somehow mocked. For instance, if processing a request implies saving
  some data to the database, the component can instead write such data to a log (mocking). Latter, on next sprint, the teams
  implement the interaction to the database. However, it is not advisable mocking everything, namely the components (internal)
  state. Notice that by mocking you are letting extra effort to the next sprint. Finally, all US must be demonstrable."

# 2. Analysis

*In this section the team should describe the study/analysis/comparison done with the meaning to take the best options
of design for the functionality as well as apply the suited diagrams/artifacts of analysis.*

*It is recommended to organize the content by subsections.*

## 2.1 SPOMS Conventions

|   Field    | Offset | Length |                                                                                                                                                         Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|:----------:|:------:|:------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  Version   |   0    |   1    |                                                                          SPOMSP message format version. This field is a single byte and should be interpreted as an unsigned integer (0 to 255). The present message format version number is one.                                                                           |
|    Code    |   1    |   1    |                                                                                                      This field identifies the type of request or response. It should be interpreted as an unsigned integer (0 to 255).                                                                                                      |
| D_LENGTH_1 |   2    |   1    | These two fields are used to specify the length in bytes of the DATA field. Both these fields are to be interpreted as unsigned integer numbers (0 to 255). The length of the DATA field is to be calculated as follows: D_LENGTH_1 + 256 x D_LENGTH_2. The length of the DATA field may be zero, meaning it does not exist. |
| D_LENGTH_2 |   3    |   1    | These two fields are used to specify the length in bytes of the DATA field. Both these fields are to be interpreted as unsigned integer numbers (0 to 255). The length of the DATA field is to be calculated as follows: D_LENGTH_1 + 256 x D_LENGTH_2. The length of the DATA field may be zero, meaning it does not exist. |
|    DATA    |   4    |   -    |                                                                                                                         Contains data to meet the specific needs of the participating applications.                                                                                                                          |

## 2.2 SPOMSP Message Codes

|:----:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0   | COMMTEST - Communications test request with no other effect on the server application than the response with a code two message (ACK). This request has no data.                                       |
|  1   | DISCONN - End of session request. The server is supposed to respond with a code two message, afterwards both applications are expected to close the session (TCP connection). This request has no data |
|  2   | ACK - Generic acknowledgment message. Used in response to requests with codes zero and one but may be used for other requests. This response has no data.                                              |
|  3   | US2003 - Assign Order                                                                                                                                                                                  |
