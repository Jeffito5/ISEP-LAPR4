# US3001 - Create Questionnaire
=======================================

# 1. Analysis

## 1.1. User Story Description and Interpretation

#### Description:

> As Sales Manager, I want to create a new questionnaire to be further answered by customers meeting the specified criteria (e.g.: have ordered a given product; belong to a given age group).

#### Acceptance Criteria

> The set of questions/answers composing the questionnaire should be expressed and validated (parsed) using the grammar being developed for this purpose.

## 1.2. Client Clarifications

### From Document

* > A questionnaire must be answered by a <u>target audience</u>

<br>

* > For any questionnaire there must be the ability to generate dynamically a proper user interface.

<br>

* > The ability to validate a given response in accordance with the questionnaire <u>specification</u>.

<br>

* > To provide a <u>statistical report</u> given a set of responses to a given questionnaire.

<br>

* > Other aspects such as data/information persistence and the distribution of the questionnaire by the the target audiences can become dependent of the target system (e.g.:SPOMS).

<br>

* > A questionnaire is a <u>set of questions</u> organized into one or more <u>sections</u> (i.e., a group of questions).

<br>

* > Each <u>question</u> is of a certain <u>type</u> (e.g.: free text, multiple choices, ordering/ranking choices) which constraints the information to be requested.

<br>

* > Yet, it is worth considering that a questionnaire might have <u>mandatory and optional sections/questions</u> and that some sections/questions might become mandatory/optional depending on the answer given to a previous question.

<br>

* > **<u>Customer:</u>** responsible for (...) and answer a survey <u>questionnaire</u>.

<br>

* > A <u>survey</u> is characterized by an <u>alphanumeric code, a description, the period(days) it will be performed, the intended questionnaire and a set of rules that allows the system to determine the survey target audience.</u>

### From Forum

* > **Q:** When we create a survey, is there a default set of question predefined when creating it, or do we need to create the questions themselves one by one for every survey?
  > <br><br>
  > **A:** No. All surveys are distinct. As so, each survey is defined from the scratch.

* > **Q:** Do we only want to show the notification to the client, or do we also use it to get a certain statistic with it that demands it?
  > <br><br>
  > **A:** Notifications are shown and used to ease the client to answer the survey.

## 4. Annotations

As a team, we choose to keep the entities 'Section' and 'Question' instead of what was advised for this US which was to
only create a Questionnaire with a String that would be validated in ANTLR.

Although it goes against what was advised by the technical team, we as a team choose not to follow such instructions due
to the following reasons:

* Keeping Section and Question as Entities being persisted and having their own place in the app, we can guarantee there
  is room for maintenance.
* Having Section and Question as entities being persisted, allows us to have more control given that we are now able to
  execute database queries if required.
* Designing a grammar to read and process an entire Questionnaire, with its Sections and Questions, would make the
  process of answering such questions harder for a client.
* A grammar to validate a full questionnaire would be fragile, with great room for imperfections and would be against
  what we've learned so far.
* The process of creating such a String is too demanding of the user. It would need to follow specific rules and formats
  to be able to register a questionnaire.
* It becomes easier to implement the next User Stories if there is specific classes already defined and is easier to add
  further functionalities.
* This way, we'll be only validating a Question's text, based on the chosen question type. This will allow us to use
  ANTLR in a more meaningful way, to verify <u>only</u> what the user has written, and what <u>truly</u> needs to be
  analysed and verified, given the complexity of a question.
* It becomes easier to operate and validate certain conditions set by the user, for example, when a Question is
  conditional and a condition needs to be set.

Cons:

* We don't follow the exact vision of the technical team.
* We won't have such a complex ANTLR grammar (Which can be a double-edge sword).
